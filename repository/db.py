    """Database Class: This class contains all methods that let us filter, search, update, deleting our database, basically consist of a serie of methods that let us manipulate the dabase. For this reason, this class contains the logic of this manipulation of database, which it's important because this class belong to Repository Module where this module is where all related to database is. The main advantage fo this class is that other module can use this class and use these methods without knowling the logic behind, so for example. Service module doesn't need to implement logic to manipulate Database in its module, but Service module can directly use this class to manipulate Database. There is less coupling.
